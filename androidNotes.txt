Setting up SurfaceView
----------------------
1) Make a View extending SurfaceView, implementing SurfaceHolder.callback
2) In constructor, getHolder().addCallback(this)
3) Wait to draw to onSurfaceCreated
    3a) Canvas c = getHolder().lockCanvas()
    3b) c.postAndUnlock();

SurfaceView
-----------
Must not use canvas until onSurfaceCreated
Must not pass the SurfaceHolder into any other places until onSurfaceCreated (makes no sense, but empirically true)


Hex grid:
---------
draw 1 then repeat properly.

 internal angle = 2pi / 6 = pi/3
 side length a.



--I was dumb calling a method on a thread object. It still runs in the other thread (derp.) Need to call a method
that "posts" that something needs to be done, and have an event loop.
